# VanHackathon - Team //TODO: - Dream&Shop App

This is a project from Vanhackathon and was created for the challenges of Dreamify and Shopify.
We had to create a new feed concept for dreamify, and a new sales channel for Shopify. So we created a single app who people can create 
a dream, something that want to achieve, and then, people can attach Shopify products, Youtube videos or images from gallery that may ilustrate 
what will be mandatory to complete that dream.


 > *This is app was created in 2 days and will not be continued.
 > You can check the [screenshots](/screenshots/) and the [apk file](/apk/).*

### Developed knowledges.
 * Learned how to integrate Firebase Storage.
 * Learned how to use Youtube Android Player API
 * Learned how to use Shopify API REST (Not Shopify Android SDK).
 
 >*I couldn't use [Shopify Android SDK](https://help.shopify.com/api/sdks/mobile-buy-sdk/android) because this library uses an old version of Android Google Play Services(8.4.0).
 >The Google Firebase, also used in this project, is only compatible with Google Play Services 9.0.0 and above.*
 >An [issue](https://github.com/Shopify/mobile-buy-sdk-android/issues/319) was created on [Shopify Android SQK GitHuhb repository](https://github.com/Shopify/mobile-buy-sdk-android).
 >I also created a [question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40191325/multiple-dex-files-define-lcom-google-android-gms-internal-zzrx) on StackOverflow about this issue.
